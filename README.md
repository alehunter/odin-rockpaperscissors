This is a simple UI for Rock Paper Scissors.

When the page is loaded, the 'command' div is initialized with a default "Start Game" text.

There are three option buttons on the left side. As soon as the user clicks on an option, a random choice from a choices array is assigned to computerChoice.

The result is then compared to the user choice and the results are displayed in the 'command' div. \
The computer choice is shown directly under.
